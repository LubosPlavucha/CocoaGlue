**Cocoa Glue**
----------
Cocoa Touch bindings. This library contains customized Cocoa Touch components, which can bind themselves to the model objects. The inspiration for this project was the OS X Cocoa binding technology. Unfortunately, similar technology doesn't exist for iOS and the developer usually has to manually collect the data the user enters into GUI component and then map them to the model object properties. This is a tedious work, which can be avoided.
